********** Summary **********

Below is a summary of the automatically graded exercises that are incomplete.

The output for each exercise can be any of the following:
  - 'Closed under the global context', if it is complete
  - 'MANUAL', if it is manually graded
  - A list of pending axioms, containing unproven assumptions. In this case
    the exercise is considered complete, if the axioms are all allowed.
